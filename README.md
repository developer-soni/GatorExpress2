## Deployed on AWS

## Description
Life can be stressful for college students. This is especially true due to the
challenges associated with being an independent adult who, oftentimes, must
obtain necessary items such as books, supplies, and clothing. We aim to
alleviate this burden by designing “Gator Express”, a web-based service on
which college students, staff, and faculty can easily exchange items. Students
will no longer have to pay high prices for many of their required items as most will
already be sold by their predecessors on Gator Express at a fraction of the cost.

Our application allows users to:
* Search for items to buy.
* View all the categories of posts on the website and navigate to their
preferred section.
* Sort search results.
* Click on any post and see its details, pricing, etc.
* View Gator Express’s about page.
* View the map of SFSU for reference.
* Register using name and email id (must be .edu).
* Login to create posts.

Registered users are allowed to:
* Post items to sell (Must be approved).
* View their own created posts.
* View messages received from prospective buyers.
* Send their contact information to a seller via one-way chat.

Admin are allowed to:
* Manage posts created by the users.
* View requests to add posts.
* Delete inappropriate posts.
* Approve posts before they go live.

We will ensure that all users can make informed decisions when selecting a
meeting location by displaying a labeled map within our UI. Furthermore, the map
will provide users with the locations of SFSU’s police department and
“Emergency Blue Light Phones”, so that the users can make exchanges with
maximum personal security incomparable to exchanges made on competing
platforms.
